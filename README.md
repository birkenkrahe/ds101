# What is this?

This repo contains the finished lecture material and some extra
material (bookmarks, scripts) for the course "Introduction to data
science" at HWR Berlin, first taught in winter 2020. The lectures
are numbered. Each ZIP file contains the Emacs Org-Mode source file
and the processed HTML and PDF files.

# Download the ZIP file

Find the `Code` menu on this page, open the menu and click on
`Download ZIP`. This will download the content of the whole folder
as a ZIP file to your computer.

# Unpack the ZIP file

Either unpack the ZIP file - e.g. `1_oveRview.zip` using your
explorer application (where you access your files), or type

    unzip 1_oveRview.zip 

The unpacking should generate a folder named `1_oveRview`. Enter
the folder. Inside you find three files to look at and another folder:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">File</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">`oveRview.html`</td>
<td class="org-left">HTML file for active viewing in a browser</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">`oveRview.pdf`</td>
<td class="org-left">PDF file for reading/printing</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">`oveRview.org`</td>
<td class="org-left">Emacs Org-mode file</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">`img`</td>
<td class="org-left">Folder with images</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

There's nothing to do for you with the `.org` file or with the `img`
folder unless you want to change it.

# Open the HTML file

Either click on the file in your explorer, which should open a browser window, or type

    [browser] oveRview.html

where `browser` is `firefox` or `google-chrome` or any other
browser. The HTML file is spruced up with Javascript - you can
toggle between two modes: either view the entire file on one page,
or view one section per page.

# Read the PDF file

Open the PDF file `oveRview.pdf` and print and/or read it. The PDF
has active links embedded in the text.
